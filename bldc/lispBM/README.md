# LispBM

This is the VESC-integration of [lispBM](https://github.com/svenssonjoel/lispBM) written by Joel Svensson. It allows the VESC to run lisp-programs in a sandboxed environment.

### Feature Overview

* Development and testing in VESC Tool with variable live monitoring and plotting as well as CPU and memory monitoring.
* Sandboxed environment, meaning that the Lisp code (hopefully) cannot freeze or crash the rest of the VESC code when it gets stuck or runs out of heap or stack memory.
* The application runs on the VESC itself without the need for having VESC Tool connected and is stored in flash memory.
* When a lisp-application is written to the VESC it is automatically started on each boot.

## Documentation

Basics about LispBM are documented [here](http://svenssonjoel.github.io/lbmdoc/html/lbmref.html). The VESC-specific extensions are documented in this section. Note that VESC Tool includes a collection of examples that can be used as a starting point for using lisp on the VESC.

### Various Commands

#### print

```clj
(print arg1 ... argN)
```

Print to the VESC Tool Lisp console. Example:

```clj
(print "Hello World")
```

Should work for all types.

#### timeout-reset

```clj
(timeout-reset)
```

Reset the timeout that stops the motor. This has to be run on at least every second to keep the motor running. The timeout time can be configured in App Settings->General.

#### get-ppm

```clj
(get-ppm)
```

Read the decoded value on the PPM input and returns 0.0 to 1.0. Note that the PPM app has to be configured and running. Example:

```clj
(print (list "PPM Value: " (get-ppm)))
```

Note that control type can be set to Off in the PPM app to get the input without running the motor automatically, which is useful when running the motor from lisp.

#### get-encoder

```clj
(get-encoder)
```

Get angle from selected encoder in degrees.

#### set-servo

```clj
(set-servo value)
```

Set servo output to value. Range 0 to 1. Note that the servo output has to be enabled in App Settings -> General.

#### get-vin

```clj
(get-vin)
```

Get input voltage.

#### select-motor

```clj
(select-motor motor)
```

Select which motor to control on dual-motor hardware. Options are 1 for motor 1 and 2 for motor 2.

#### get-selected-motor

```clj
(get-selected-motor)
```

Get currently selected motor on dual motor hardware.

#### get-bms-val

```clj
(get-bms-val val optValArg)
```

Get value from BMS. Examples:

```clj

(get-bms-val "v_cell" 2) ; Cell 3 voltage (index starts from 0)
(get-bms-val "bal_state 2") ; Cell 3 balancing state. 0: not balancing, 1: balancing
(get-bms-val "temp_adc_num") ; Temperature sensor count
(get-bms-val "temps_adc" 2) ; Get sensor 3 temperature (index starts from 0)
(get-bms-val "temp_ic") ; Balance IC temperature
(get-bms-val "temp_hum") ; Humidity sensor temperature
(get-bms-val "hum") ; Humidity
(get-bms-val "temp_cell_max") ; Maximum cell temperature
(get-bms-val "soc") ; State of charge (0.0 to 1.0)

```

Get ADC voltage on channel ch (0, 1 or 2).

#### systime

```clj
(systime)
```

Get system time in ticks since boot. Every tick is 0.1 ms.

#### secs-since

```clj
(secs-since timestamp)
```

#### set-aux

```clj
(set-aux ch state)
```

Set AUX output ch (1 or 2) to state. Example:

```clj
(set-aux 1 1) ; Set AUX1 to ON.
```

Note: The AUX output mode must be set to Unused in Motor Settings->General->Advanced. Otherwise the firmware will change the AUX state directly after it is set using this function.

### Motor Set Commands

(set-current current)
```

Set motor current in amperes.

#### set-current-rel

```clj
(set-current-rel current)

#### can-send-sid
```clj

```

Send standard ID CAN-frame with id and data. Data is a list with bytes, and the length of the list (max 8) decides how many data bytes are sent. Example:

```clj

```

#### can-send-eid

### Bit Operations

#### bits-enc-int
```clj
(bits-enc-int initial number offset bits)
```

Put bits of number in initial at offset and return the result. For example, if the bits initial are aaaaaaaa, number is bbb, offset is 2 and bits is 3 the result is aaabbbaa. For reference, the corresponding operation in C is:

```c
initial &= ~((0xFFFFFFFF >> (32 - bits)) << offset);
initial |= (number << (32 - bits)) >> (32 - bits - offset);
```

#### bits-dec-int
```clj
(bits-dec-int value offset size)
```

Return size bits of value at offset. For example if the bits of value are abcdefgh, offset is 3 and size it 3 a number with the bits cde is returned. The corresponding operation in C is:

```c
val >>= offset;
val &= 0xFFFFFFFF >> (32 - bits);
```

## Events

Events can be used to execute code for certain events, such as when CAN-frames are received. To use events you must first register an event handler, then enable the events you want to receive. As the event handler blocks until the event arrives it is useful to spawn a thread to handle events so that other things can be done in the main thread at the same time.

The following example shows how to spawn a thread that handles SID (standard-id) CAN-frames:

```clj
(define proc-sid (lambda (id data)
    (print (list id data)) ; Print the ID and data
))

(define event-handler (lambda ()
    (progn
        (recv ((signal-can-sid (? id) . (? data)) (proc-sid id data))
              (_ nil)) ; Ignore other events
        (event-handler) ; Call self again to make this a loop
)))

; Spawn the event handler thread and pass the ID it returns to C
(event-register-handler (spawn '(event-handler)))

; Enable the CAN event for standard ID (SID) frames
(event-enable "event-can-sid")
```

Possible events to register are

```clj
(event-enable "event-can-sid") ; Sends (signal-can-sid id data), where id is U32 and data is a list of i28
(event-enable "event-can-eid") ; Sends (signal-can-eid id data), where id is U32 and data is a list of i28
```

## How to update

To update from remote repository:

```
git remote add lispBM git@github.com:svenssonjoel/lispBM.git
git subtree pull --squash --prefix=lispBM/lispBM/ lispBM master
```

The first command might fail if it already is added, but the second one should still work. If there are uncomitted changes you can run **git stash** before the commands and **git stash pop** after them.
